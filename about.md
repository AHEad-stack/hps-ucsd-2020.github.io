# About HPS

## General

Human-Powered Submarine (HPS) is a UC San Diego based student organization that designs, constructs, and competes with a human-propelled, fully flooded submarine.  

Each year, students dedicate their time to manufacturing and testing their submarine in preparation for the International Submarine Races (ISR) in Bethesda, Maryland, and the European International Submarine Races (eISR) in Gosport, UK. 

Students on the team come from a variety of backgrounds and majors in order to develop skills in machining, CAD, composites, and leadership.  Many have gone on to pursue research or internships related to their work on the team. While the studentsâ€™ specific interests are varied, their dedication and enthusiasm are reflected in their final product.
