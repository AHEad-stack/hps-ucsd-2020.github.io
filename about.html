			<div class="box-body">
				<p>Human-Powered Submarine (HPS) is a UC San Diego based student organization that designs, constructs, and competes with a human-propelled, fully flooded submarine.</p>
				<p>Each year, students dedicate their time to manufacturing and testing their submarine in preparation for the International Submarine Races (ISR) in Bethesda, Maryland, and the European International Submarine Races (eISR) in Gosport, UK.
				</p>
				<p>Students on the team come from a variety of backgrounds and majors in order to develop skills in machining, CAD, composites, and leadership. Many have gone on to pursue research or internships related to their work on the team. While the
					students’ specific interests are varied, their dedication and enthusiasm are reflected in their final product.</p>
				<p>Check out our wiki and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/hpsucsd" target="_blank">youtube channel</a> to see how we make the submarine!</p>

				<h2>Latest Submarine</h2>
			</div>

			<div class="box-body">
				<p>Our latest submarine is Santiana, which we intended to race in ISR 2019.</p>
				<p>Santiana’s hull was retrofitted from “Spicy Tuna Roll,” raced in ISR 14, which was made with a wet layup of fiberglass. The nose-cone and windows were replaced, the steering was improved upon, and the propulsion system was changed from a
					tuna
					tail to a new propeller.</p>
