- name: Drivetrain
  contents: drivetrain.html
  text: "The Drivetrain subteam designs and manufactures the propulsion mechanism of the submarine. They efficiently convert the pilot’s pedaling motion to power a propellor or a non-propellor system (like a fish tail, for instance), developing both computer-aided design and machining skills."
- name: Hull
  contents: hull.html
  text: "The Hull subteam designs, simulates and manufactures the outer shell of the submarine, balancing hydrodynamics, speed, and maneuverability. They make use of computer-aided modeling software as well as get their hands dirty when laying up, curing, and sanding the hull."
- name: Dive

  text: "The Dive subteam coordinates all dive related activities such as pool tests, scuba certification for new members and elaborating safety protocols."
- name: HSI and Steering
  contents: hsi.html
  text: "The HSI subteam is responsible for the pilot’s interaction with the submarine through controls and steering mechanisms."
- name: Electronics
