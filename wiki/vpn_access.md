## VPN Access

### What is a VPN? What will we use it for?
A VPN server is a powerful computer that you can access remotely. This allows you to use applications like Solidworks and COMSOL without downloading them on your personal computer.

The school offers a couple different VPN services under the name of "Cloudlabs," and the specific one we use is called "Apporto." They have our team under the name "SUBMARINE_ORG".

### For Documentation Leads - Adding Members
* Get the UCSD username and PID of the interested members
* Open a ticket by emailing "servicedesk@ucsd.edu" from the team's email account : submarine.ucsd@gmail.com.
* Write a descriptive but concise email.

Example email:

> Subject: Adding Members to add to Student Org Apporto Access

> > We would like to add the following members to the "SUBMARINE_ORG" organization on Apporto.

> > jsmith, A12345678

> > Thank you,
> > Human Powered Submarine @ UCSD


* It is preferable to add multiple members at the same time if possible.
* They will probably add them within a few business days.

### Accessing your VPN
* You can access Apporto through cloudlabs.ucsd.edu
* You'll have to log in with your UCSD account.
* If you have been registered, there should be a "SUBMARINE_ORG" button
* You'll then have to click Launch to start the Apporto GPU desktop in your browser
* It should work just like a little computer inside your computer!
* Be sure to disconnect when you are done.
