### 3/5/21

#### Agenda:

- Took plug and materials to SunRez
- Detached plug from current tabletop to repair extensive damage, and also it was not level.
- Bought new plywood to replace table top. 
- Discarded female mold, due to air leaks and poor surface quality.

#### For next time:

- Make new tabletop.
- Create new mold the correct way (Mark from SunRez will show us!)
- Attach plug to tabletop
- Seal tabletop and repair plug surface

#### NOTES:

Wear PROPER PPE:

- N95 mask
- Designate long sleeves and pants for workdays (to protect from fiberglass)
- Safety Glasses
- Pull back hair

Regarding Manufacturing:

- Must be on a level surface
- Mold must be airtight

Methods for Removing Fiberglass:

- Thoroughly use air hose at the end of workday to remove fiberglass from clothes and shoes. (Avoid touching your face too much)
- Wrap duct-tape around fingers and dap onto any exposed skin
- Use a vacuum - with the nozzle removed.

What we did
- table not level
- clamped it to long, straight metal beams
- use a level to make sure its not warped (make sure the 2 short sides are level)
- use sawhorses that r the same height (extra sawhorse in the middle for support)
- wood shims and bondo to fill in gaps
- golf ball size grey stuff and 1+1/4 inch harderner mix (just read the bondo instructions)
- wear gloves for bondo, well venilated area if possible
- clean bondo putty knives asap after each use with acetone
- screwed tabletop (mark the 2x4 with sharpie to use as a guide!
- cut holes in the bottom panel for access - in order to drill the plug to the table later
- note: use a big drill bit to cut a hole for the jigsaw to fit into, then use a jigsaw to actually cut out the entire shape
- make sure there is a centerline on the plug, and draw a straight line on the table to line them up
- Line beam up along the plug side, use another straight edge at a 90 deg angle, make sure distance from beam to point of contact is equal at nose and tail, which is 12‚Äù for us

Random tips
- panchos is a good place for lunch!
- they like it when u keep the back door closed at sunrez 
- bring tangerines as a snack!

More fiberglass tips
- Use back of sponge for fiberglass on hands and  s c r u b
- or use reallllly hot water, then reallly cold water (pores will close up and eject the fiberglass?? appearantly)
