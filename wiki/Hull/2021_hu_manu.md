### 3/5/21

#### Agenda:

- Took plug and materials to SunRez
- Detached plug from current tabletop, because it was not level.
- Bought new plywood to replace table top. 
- Broke down current mold, because not airtight.

#### For next time:

- Make new tabletop.
- Create new mold the correct way (Mark from SunRez will show us!)

#### NOTES:

Wear PROPER PPE:

- N95 mask
- Designate long sleeves and pants for workdays (to protect from fiberglass)
- Safety Glasses
- Pull back hair

Regarding Manufacturing:

- Must be on a level surface
- Mold must be airtight

Methods for Removing Fiberglass:

- Thoroughly use air hose at the end of workday to remove fiberglass from clothes and shoes. (Avoid touching your face too much)
- Wrap duct-tape around fingers and dap onto any exposed skin
- Use a vacuum - with the nozzle removed.
