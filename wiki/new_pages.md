## Creating New Pages

### Preparation
Before you can add new pages to the Wiki, you must be added to the [HPS GitHub](https://github.com/hps-ucsd-2020). Create an account on GitHub and request an admin (Team Captain, Documentation Lead, etc) to add you to the Team GitHub.

### Actually adding pages
After that setup, creating new wiki pages is as easy as hitting "Add new" at the top-right of the page. Wiki pages use the [kramdown](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/quickref.html) markdown system for formatting. 

There are two options for adding pages - using GitHub's file editor, and using Prose.io. Use whichever system is more comfortable to you.

Happy Editing!
