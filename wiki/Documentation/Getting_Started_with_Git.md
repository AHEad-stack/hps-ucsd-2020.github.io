# Let's set up Github on your Personal Device

1. Create a [Github account](https://github.com/).
2. Ask a current HPS member to give you access permission to the HPS repository, which will link your new account to it.
3. Download the [Github Desktop app](https://desktop.github.com/) to do Git stuff, and the [Sublime app](https://www.sublimetext.com/) to edit files. 
4. Go to our HPS github repository, and using the Github app, clone the repository onto your computer.
5. To edit files, on the Github app ribbon (File, Edit, View, etc), click "Repository" --> "Open in External Editor" and select Sublime as your editor.
6. Download Ruby and Jekyll to run the website locally.
    - This may vary based on your Operating systems, if it's not Windows 10.
