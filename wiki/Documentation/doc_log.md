# Documentation Team Log!

## 7/6/2021
Hey It's Antoinette~

Did:
- Gathered pictures for Dr. Becker in this [Google Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RZ4ywF5MG9XobbFNfNsmHptrais8jHMW?usp=sharing)
- Started doc log (idea is for each team to have one to track progress, make it a daily thing?)

On the to-do list for the website (really the only things left):
- Home page Remodel
- Members Page
    1. Redraw and crop default diver drawing
    2. Cut all member pics out, crop and make bg-less
    3. Remove quotes (sry Parth)
- Really gotta think about how to upload, crop, compress and change pics on the website easilyyy (rethink folder structure?)
    1. Displaying photos on wiki, figure that out (everyone needs to be able to do that)
    2. Changing the photos on the home page or team pages to keep them current? Maybe only doc members need to worry abt this
    3. Basically a good photo storage/naming system would be *fanstastique*

Less important but also on the to-do list:
- Figure out a prettier way to display these logs (and the manu logs for hull)

That's all for today!

Made good progress on the member page today! I redrew the diver and figured out how to change the bubble sizes.

To do list for next time:
- Fix layout issues so name and position are hugging the image closer
- Add new roster for 2021-2022 with proper positions
- cut out square + bg-less images of everyone!

Note, some documentation is starting to happen in HSI which is exciting! Also image uploading does work, Ky has confirmed it, it's actually not a huge ordeal!
I will reach out to Shubham again about the compression algorithm and cropping tool, but I really don't think it is too much of an issue?

## 8/19/21
Switched it up and worked on homepage remodel today!
I finally switched to using a Personal Auth Token instead of a password. I made a nice new branch for the remodel, added a small description box and social media buttons.

To do in the future:
- Graphic about merchandise for homepage
- Make flyers for Oceans 21
- Make post graphic abt Oceans 21
- Eventually, go through other main pages and do a clean up (About, Members, Teams, Donate)


## 10/23/21
Things that need to happen soon:
- Add logo to the homepage
- Get all leads set up with a log (sheets or direct on wiki - make sure they know how to edit it)
- Update photos on home page?
- Update member photos and add new members!
