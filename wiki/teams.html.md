<h4>Drivetrain</h4>
<p>The Drivetrain subteam designs and manufactures the propulsion mechanism of the submarine. 
They efficiently convert the pilot’s pedaling motion to power a propellor or a non-propellor system (like a fish tail, for instance), 
developing both computer-aided design and machining skills. </p>

<h4>Hull</h4>
<p>The Hull subteam designs, simulates and manufactures the outer shell of the submarine, balancing hydrodynamics, speed, and maneuverability.
They make use of computer-aided modeling software as well as get their hands dirty when laying up, curing, and sanding the hull.</p>

<h4>Dive</h4>
<p>The Dive subteam coordinates all dive related activities such as pool tests, scuba certification for new members and elaborating safety protocols.</p> 

<h4>HSI / Steering</h4>
<p>The HSI subteam is responsible for the pilot’s interaction with the submarine through controls and steering mechanisms.</p>

<h4>Electronics</h4>
<p>The Electronics subteam creates and programs experimental devices to enhance the submarine, developing projects like electronic steering and buoyancy control.</p>


<h4>Documentation / Media </h4>
<p>The Documentation / Media subteam chronicles and organizes the research and processes used by all other subteams for posterity,
as well as communicates our journey by creating and managing our own website, wiki and social media. </p>
