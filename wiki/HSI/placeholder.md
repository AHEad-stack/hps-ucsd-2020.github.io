## Plans for Life and the Future

### Mechanical Steering
The 2020-20201 sub's steering mechanism will be similar to Santiana's, with minor yet significant changes. Starting from the rear back: due to the increased size of the drivetrain the linkage bar mechanism which Santiana utilized will be impossible. Due to this, the new steering will use a more intricate cable system including a splitter for both the top/bottom steering fin pair and the left/rigths steering fin pair. The pilot interface will be similar to Santiana's, with two throttle-like controls. This sub's, however, will include adjustable levers for increased flexibility in the maneuvering of the sub. These levers will be three-hole attachment points on both the pilot interface and the fin interface with the cables, creating mechanical advantages of 1, >1, and <1. 

### Electronic Steering
Due to COVID-related setbacks, a less risky approach to steering is being taken. Previously, there were plans to incorporate electronic steering mechanisms. This would allow for an easier pilot control and greater finesse in fin positioning.
