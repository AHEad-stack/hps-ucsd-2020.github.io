# HSI Log 2021 - 2022

## Resources:

## 10/30/21
- Had lunch in PC yum yum
- Need a budget.
   - I think we have about $500 from electronic steering and might use some of Drivetrain's budget 
- Steering
    - Rough design of mechanical steering system
    - Looked into y-splitter for morse cables
- HSI
    - Measured how large the main hatch is on Santiana and transferred it to Calypso (37 inches)
    - Measured Ky for hatch size 
    - Made access hatch and deadman buoy cutout
    - Finalized that hatch and viewport is separate 
    - Found release mechanism for main hatch
    - Modified side plates
    - More space for steering mechanism 
    - Explained and drew mechanical steering and and deadman buoy 
- Alaina needs a better sleep schedule and eating habits

## 11/6/21
- Hatch
     - Marked out hatch placement on top half of hull
     - Cutting out hatch next week
- Foam
     - Calculated necessary buoyancy for hatch and how much foam is needed (see picture of whiteboard)
- Deadman buoy
     - Planned out design of deadman buoy
     - Still need to work on winding mechanism
- Plans for next week
     - CAD deadman buoy
     - CAD steering system
     - Access hatch placement (and how many hatches)
     - How to attach and open hatches
     - Hull end cut-off hatch
     - Stabilizing/dorsal fin
     - Lecture on better sleep/eating habits?
     - Practice Chinese and translate all drawings into Chinese for manufacturing

## 11/13/21
- Hatch
      - Cut out hatch
      - Hull added foam to hatch (insert picture of calculations)
      - Sanded edges 
      - Access hatch will remain at the bottom of the hull
- Steering
      - Finalized that we won’t/can’t split the morse cable 
      - Going with similar steering system to Santiana
      - Started the CAD for the linkage
- Things to do next week
      - CAD steering system
      - CAD deadman buoy
      - Figure out what to do with end of tail (turn it into a hatch or put in tailcone)
      - Latch mechanism for hatches 
      - Stabilizing fins?
