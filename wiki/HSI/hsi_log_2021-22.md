# HSI Log 2021 - 2022

## Resources:

## 10/30/21
- Had lunch in PC yum yum
- Need a budget.
   - I think we have about $500 from electronic steering and might use some of Drivetrain's budget 
- Steering
    - Rough design of mechanical steering system
    - Looked into y-splitter for morse cables
- HSI
    - Measured how large the main hatch is on Santiana and transferred it to Calypso (37 inches)
    - Measured Ky for hatch size 
    - Made access hatch and deadman buoy cutout
    - Finalized that hatch and viewport is separate 
    - Found release mechanism for main hatch
    - Modified side plates
    - More space for steering mechanism 
    - Explained and drew mechanical steering and and deadman buoy 

## 11/6/21
- Hatch
     - Marked out hatch placement on top half of hull
     - Cutting out hatch next week
- Foam
     - Calculated necessary buoyancy for hatch and how much foam is needed (see picture of whiteboard)
- Deadman buoy
     - Planned out design of deadman buoy
     - Still need to work on winding mechanism
- Plans for next week
     - CAD deadman buoy
     - CAD steering system
     - Access hatch placement (and how many hatches)
     - How to attach and open hatches
     - Hull end cut-off hatch
     - Stabilizing/dorsal fin
     - Lecture on better sleep/eating habits?
     - Practice Chinese and translate all drawings into Chinese for manufacturing

## 11/13/21
- Hatch
     - Cut out hatch
     - Hull added foam to hatch (insert picture of calculations)
     - Sanded edges 
     - Access hatch will remain at the bottom of the hull
- Steering
     - Finalized that we won’t/can’t split the morse cable 
     - Going with similar steering system to Santiana
     - Started the CAD for the linkage
- Things to do next week
     - CAD steering system
     - CAD deadman buoy
     - Figure out what to do with end of tail (turn it into a hatch or put in tailcone)
     - Latch mechanism for hatches 
     - Stabilizing fins?

## 11/20/21
- Steering 
   - Finished CADing half of the steering system (yaw fins)
     - Decided to use 1 inch aluminium extrusions to connect the fins together 
     - Extrusions connected by drop in fasteners and coner connecters 
     - The fins themselves are connected to the aluminium extrusions by drilling a 0.205” hole through the 0.5” rod to connect it to the hole in the center of the aluminium extrusion
     - Lengths of extrusions are not finalized
     - At one end, there is a horizontal bar that connects to the morse cable at different lengths from the center to provide a 1:1, 2:1, and 3:1 mechanical advantage, with a max deflection of 18.4 degrees in each direction
     - The morses cable moves at most 1 inch 
- Deadman buoy
     - Ethan worked with Miles to CAD deadman buoy and the bucket holding it in the sub
- Attachment to the hull
     - We will put foam along the inside edges of the hull, fiberglass it in, drill holes through both layers (slightly larger than the screw diameter to make sure the screw can remain perpendicular to the hole)
     - We will place threaded inserts on the deadman bucket for the screws to screw into (attached with epoxy)
     - This allows us to remove the bucket whenever we need to service the drivetrain
