Used fusion 360 for CAM and tried to get adaptive clearing set up for the wasteboar but ran into issues.  Eventually landed on peck drilling with a chamfer tool to eventuall hand drill all the mounting holes for the wasteboard.  

Jack worked on creating a tool library for our current endmills.

Jared made some temporary hold plates and cut the mdf for the machine.

Wasteboard was cut out of 3/4" mdf that can be resurfaced every month or so depending on how marked up it gets.  Ideally, there would be scraps placed under cut parts to keep it fresh.  The goal of the wasteboard is to provide a machine level surface to mount parts and finish tramming the machine.  This is incredibly important when cutting metal, but not so much for wood.  The end goal is increasing the accuracy as much as we can of the shapeoko, hence why it has taken so long to get to this point.  You have to be diligent about every step along the way because of how many variables there are.  Don't half-ass any of this work, the investment you put in now will save an uncountable number of future issues down the line.

This project deserves much more documentation but today will be a start.  Look for future logs
