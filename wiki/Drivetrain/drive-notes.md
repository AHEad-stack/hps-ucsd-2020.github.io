## General Drive Notes

### Overview

At HPS, we create a new drivetrain every 2 years. We alternate between propeller and non propeller designs, and recently we have been concentrating on our non propeller design. To create a drivetrain, we follow the following steps:

Design the drivetrain: We research possible designs, from different linkages to continuous gearing methods. We then create our system In CAD using Solidworks, which allows us to visualize and adjust our designs.

Manufacture the drivetrain: We then bring our design to life using both manual and CNC manufacturing methods. Usually, we utilize UCSDâ€™s machine shops to do this, but with the pandemic closing these doors, we took matters into our own hands. We purchased a Shapeoko Desktop CNC machine to create our drivetrain parts in our own space.

Test the drivetrain: While the drivetrain may work in theory, we of course must test our system to work out the kinks. This is done both on land and in test pools, and after each test modifications are made to create optimal performance.
